# Travelmantics

This is an app that allows a travel agent's customers to get information about travel deals in real time. 
The first time you open the Travelmantics app, you are presented with a log-in screen. 
For the login, you'll have two options, insert a username and password, or use a Google account. 
After the login, two things may happen. If you are a customer, you'll see the list of travel deals currently available, 
and if you click on one of the deals, you'll see the details of the deal you have selected with a bigger image,
but if you are a Globomantics administrator, you'll also be able to create new travel deals, 
insert pictures, or edit and delete existing travel deals. 
All data and pictures will be stored remotely within Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage, 
and authentication will also happen on the cloud. 
The user interface, the connection to Firebase services and interaction with users, will happen from the app.
